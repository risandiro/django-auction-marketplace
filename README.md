Auction-style marketplace where users can post listings, place bids, manage a watchlist, and browse by category. Built as a capstone-style web app (Django + SQLite).

## Features

- User registration, login, and logout (custom user model)
- Create listings with title, description, image URL, starting bid, and category (only for logged users)
- Active / closed listings; highest bid wins when a listing is closed
- Place bids with validation (must exceed current bid and meet minimum)
- Watchlist: add/remove listings and quick access from the nav
- Comments on listings
- Category pages and "all categories" overview
- Django admin for content management (optional)

## Tech stack

- **Python 3**
- **Django** 3.x
- **SQLite** (development)
- **HTML / CSS** (Django templates)
